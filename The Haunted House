Maya and her friends were taking a late evening stroll in their neighbourhood when they crossed paths with an old couple walking down the lane. They began to have a conversation with this couple they had never seen before. The old couple generously invited them to their home for a cup of coffee. The group of friends very reluctantly accepted the offer. They all followed the couple to their huge, isolated mansion. While the friends waited for the coffee, Maya decided to help out the old couple. As she walked towards the kitchen, May heard a loud noise from the dark hallway. She walked down the hallway believing that it would lead her to the ktichen when...

It did! She arrived safely in the kitchen, with no more looming dread. Seeing the older couple pouring coffee for herself and friends, Maya realized that her lack of sleep was making her paranoid. After helping with the coffee and grabbing some bread Maya lead the couple back to the living room where her friends were waiting. To Maya's surprise, the living room was empty and eerily quiet. A rush of panic came over her. She turned around to question the older couple. They stood still behind her, each holding only their own coffee now. As the husband took a sip of his, the wife whispered to Maya...."it's going to be a long night".

The husband slowly drew back into a corridor and Maya just heard a door open and close. She was horrified. When the husband came out there was this loud crash followed by the Husband screaming and cursing. He seemed to gather himself and he walked out...with a Monopoly set. The couple had been waiting ages for someone to come along and play this game with them. Maya went to jail over and over again and kept landing on everyone's properties with only a few of her own. The worst part? She had two different colors. It was a very long night indeed...And Maya never recovered from the horrors she saw that day.
